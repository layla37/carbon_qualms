# CarbonQualms - Alleviate your eco-anxiety with some good old fashioned penance

WHAT IS THIS THING?
This web app allows those with eco-anxiety, to feel better about their carbon mishaps by giving them 3 penances to choose from. These penances offset the carbon footprint of their eco-sin. The user selects their eco-sin (such as driving to work instead of biking or taking public transportation) from the eco-sins dropdown menu. The 3 penances show up and they can choose a penance in order to alleviate their eco-guilt. 

HOW CAN I CONTRIBUTE?
This app needs more eco-sins (with their corresponding carbon footprints). Please let me know if you have carbon footprint data I can use via the [issue tracker](https://github.com/layla37/carbon_qualms/issues/1) or tweet some data to me: [@laylamandella](https://twitter.com/laylamandella).
